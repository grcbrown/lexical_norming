# 245B-project
This is a class project for LINGUIST 245B. 

This project seeks to answer the question of if and to what extent lexical variants reliably index a speaker's masculinity. It follows a design in which participants read a sentence and rate the characteristics of the hypothetical speaker of that sentence. This is used as a way to norm stimuli sentences for future experimental studies.
